# Starboard
### A habit-creating, goal-tracking app for iOS inspired by the star sticker boards of our childhoods.

*Starboard* is a daily goal tracking app designed to make it rewarding and easy to create new habits and achieve your goals.

## âœ¨New: SwiftUI Rewrite
*Starboard* has been rewritten from the ground up in SwiftUI using the new App protocol. SwiftUI is the future of developing for Apple's platforms and reduces the amount of work I need to do on things like UI, Cross-Platform Compatability, and Core Data implementation. The move to SwiftUI has also resulted in a smaller project size and smaller binary size.

### For Developers
The project is made on the latest software from Apple, including:
- macOS Big Sur 11.0.1+
- Xcode 12.3
